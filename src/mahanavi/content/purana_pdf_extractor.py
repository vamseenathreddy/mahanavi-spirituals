"""
purana_pdf_extractor.py: extracts Telugu text from a page range in the
source Puranam PDF via OCR (Tesseract), NOT via the PDF's own internal
text layer.

WHY OCR, NOT pdftotext: confirmed via direct testing that this specific
PDF (Astadasa_Puranalu.pdf) uses a legacy custom font encoding where
each glyph's character code does NOT map to standard Unicode Telugu --
pdftotext extraction produces garbled, unusable output even though the
PAGES THEMSELVES render correctly (the embedded font displays properly
when rasterized; only the underlying text-extraction mapping is
broken). OCR reads the actual rendered glyph shapes instead of trusting
that broken mapping, so it works regardless of the font encoding issue.

ACCURACY: a direct comparison against a manually-proofread page (the
Manasadevi episode's page 1300) showed OCR output was highly accurate,
including several spots where an earlier MANUAL visual transcription
had actually introduced errors that OCR got right. Not perfect --
occasional single-character glitches remain (a stray symbol, a dropped
vowel-length mark) -- so treat this as a strong first draft that still
deserves a quick proofread before going into a real video, not as a
guaranteed-correct final source.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT AUTOMATE: finding WHICH page range holds a good,
self-contained story (with a natural beginning/end, ideally closing in
its own mantra/stotram) still needs a human decision -- that's a
judgment call about content and story structure, not a text-extraction
problem. This tool removes the slow "manually type out what I see in
the image" bottleneck once you already know which pages to pull from.
