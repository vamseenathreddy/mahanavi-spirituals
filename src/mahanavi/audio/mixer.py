mixer.py: mixes narrated voiceover audio with ducked background music
into one combined track, and measures audio duration.

Used by the long-form Puranam video pipeline now that real voiceover
narration exists: the video's scroll speed/duration is now driven by
the ACTUAL spoken length of the narration (measured here), replacing
the earlier rough words-per-minute estimate used before voiceover
existed.
