scroll_assembler.py: assembles a long-form Puranam video from a
background deity image + a tall scrolling Telugu text image (rendered
by images/purana_text_renderer.py) + background music -- the
"end-credits" scroll technique confirmed via a real test render: the
text image is overlaid on the (darkened, for readability) background
and animated upward via ffmpeg's overlay filter with a time-varying
y-expression, entering from below the frame and exiting above it.

Separate module from video/assembler.py (the Shorts assembler) because
the two are genuinely different techniques -- Shorts are one static
frame the whole duration; this is continuous motion over the full
runtime, with a landscape 16:9 canvas instead of vertical 9:16.
