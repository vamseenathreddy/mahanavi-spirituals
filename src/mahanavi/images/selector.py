"""
Image selection: picks today's devotional image from the correct
weekday folder, without repeating an image until every image in that
folder has been used at least once.

Algorithm:
    1. Resolve today's folder (e.g. Monday -> Images/Monday_Shiva).
    2. List all valid image files in it.
    3. Ask ImageHistoryRepository which filenames have already been used
       from this folder.
    4. unused = all_files - used_files
    5. If unused is empty (every image has been used), reset the folder's
       history in the DB and treat all files as unused again — this starts
       a fresh non-repeating cycle rather than ever blocking the pipeline.
    6. Randomly choose one from `unused`.
    7. Record it as used (for today's date) so it's excluded next time.

This class deliberately knows nothing about *how* images get rendered,
what Panchang is, or how posts get published — it only answers
"which image, and where is it".
